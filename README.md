# TherianXMLtoDB
 Qt (QML) C++


It's a tool made to import data from one specific XML file into MS Access database
Tool first reads XSD file to understand data structure, then generates all required tables in the database, then copies data
Source XML, XSD and result ACCDB files can be found in GameData.zip archive


In fact this project is just a sandbox, my first glance at QML, 
a playground to mess with STL and QT containers, Qt XML and QT database tools,
and to get some C++ experience. 

It is poorly organized and structured as a result of trial and error development,
i'm going to leave it as it is, cause when and if it will be a reason to get back to it,
it will serve as a good example and experience of maintaining terribly structured project
